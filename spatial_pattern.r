# Data generating process 
# Code adapted from Andre's paper without the treatment or spatial aggregation

# Steps
# 1. create a raster grid as values of X 
# 2. define a distribution for X 
# 3. create patterns on the grid 
# 4. create a spatial weight matrix in y 
# 5. generate y

# X variables: slope, elevation, or soil type 

# Soil type pattern, Moisture level 
# Justify why we use type 1 or type 2 X, specified in the 
# 1. X ~ U (0, 5) (spatial grid pattern) 
# 2. X = (1- piW)K  or X = W^2 K , with K ~ U (0,5) 

# Y is also a function of contiguous parcels W, where our spatial matrix come in to depict the deforestation patterns.

# Simulation 

# 1000 simulations 

#The results of aggregating the observed data to different resolutions are illustrated by mapping the estimated coefficients and their standard errors against their values at the true level. 

# the vertical axis represents the magnitudes of the coefficient estimates and the horizontal axis represents the resolution chosen 

# Thus, it ranges from the pixel level, up to the highest aggregation level of 12x12 (the lowest resolution). The vertical dashed line denotes the true level, which in the case of Fig 5 case is a 6x6 resolution.
